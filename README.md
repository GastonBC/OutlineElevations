## Outline Elevations

If you've ever done elevations, you are used to making fill regions around the enclosing walls and giving it a pen thickness. This tool takes the crop region extent and overrides it's thickness to the desired number.

You can choose any amount of sheets to apply the change to and will only affect elevations. Additionally you can click the checkbox to turn off the crop regions in every other view since you will need to allow crop box printing in your printing setup.
